Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nCompounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as o 2 or f2, are called what?\n\n### Input:\nOxidants and Reductants Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as O 2 or F2, are calledoxidants (or oxidizing agents) because they can oxidize other compounds. In the process of accepting electrons, an oxidant is reduced. Compounds that are capable of donating electrons, such as sodium metal or cyclohexane (C6H12), are calledreductants (or reducing agents) because they can cause the reduction of another compound. In the process of donating electrons, a reductant is oxidized. These relationships are summarized in Equation 3.30: Equation 3.30 Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books.","referenceResponse":"oxidants"}
{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat term in biotechnology means a genetically exact copy of an organism?\n\n### Input:\nBut transgenic animals just have one novel gene. What about an animal with a whole new genome? Could a clone , a genetically exact copy of an organism, be developed using techniques associated with biotechnology? It could be argued that human cloning is one of the inevitable outcomes of modern biotechnology. It \"simply\" involves the removal of the nucleus from a somatic cell and its placement into an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed. This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a \"simple\" procedure. But animal cloning is arguably a different story.","referenceResponse":"clone"}

{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the height above or below sea level called?\n\n### Input:\nAs you know, the surface of Earth is not flat. Some places are high, and some places are low. For example, mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada in California or the Andes in South America are high above the surrounding areas. An accurate location must take into account the third dimension. Elevation is the height above or below sea level. Sea level refers to the height of the ocean\u2019s surface. This is the midpoint between high and low tide. Sea level can vary from place to place, but scientists base their elevation measurements on the average, or mean, sea level to make sure they have a standard reference point.","referenceResponse":"elevation"}

{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nMeiosis is part of the process of gametogenesis, which is the production of what?\n\n### Input:\nGametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis) Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell\u2019s life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. Spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery of the tube and the most mature sperm at the lumen of the tube (Figure 18.14). Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm. The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids. The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.","referenceResponse":"sperm and eggs"}

{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat kind of viscosity is found in long-chain hydrocarbons?\n\n### Input:\nThere is also a correlation between viscosity and molecular shape. Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become \u201ctangled\u201d with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous.","referenceResponse":"highly viscous"}
{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIonic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in this?\n\n### Input:\nIonic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in a regular array. The lattice energy (U) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; U can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. Because U depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and\/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. Higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and increased hardnessbecause more thermal energy is needed to overcome the forces that hold the ions together. Lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the Born\u2013Haber cycle, in which Hess\u2019s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. The Born\u2013Haber cycle can be used to predict which ionic compounds are likely to form. Sublimation, the conversion of a solid directly to a gas, has an accompanying enthalpy change called the enthalpy of sublimation.","referenceResponse":"regular array"}
